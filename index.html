            he finds himself. He is a beloved trader who finds favour in the eye of the queen and other women. His intransigence with the queen <br>
                is however, found out and he’s banished and nearly killed. An encounter with the mystic, aided by his wife, led him to powers to raise<br>
                people from the dead. He becomes so famous, rich and powerful that he begins to carry his shoulders too high. Coupled with his love <br>
